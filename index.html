	"“Success is going from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm.” <BR><BR>  Getting knocked around by failures is never fun or easy, but this advice from Churchill reminds us that it’s vital that you remain enthusiastic when facing your next venture, or you can expect more of the same.It’s not an easy task, but it’s clear to see that if you let your defeats get you down you only make it harder to get that next success under your belt.","Winston Churchill ",
	"The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.<br><br>Each step you take toward a bigger goal might not seem like much. It may seem like you’re not really doing much at all. This will be especially true of any outside observers. Others might think you’re not getting anywhere, that you’re not getting anything done. That’s why you have to have a lot of confidence in where you’re going.” ","Lao Tzu",
	"“Dream big and dare to fail.” <br><br>Having small dreams and being afraid to fail is the antithesis of this advice, and it’s something many of us do, even though we may not want to admit it. The two go hand in hand, if you are too afraid of failing you’ll keep your dreams on a leash. But if you overcome that fear, and jump out there fully willing to completely fail, you free your mind to dream up new adventures and goals for your life.","Norman Vaughan ",
	"“What you do speaks so loudly that I cannot hear what you say.”<br><br>Here’s a take on the “Actions speak louder than words. adage. It’s true that words can often be contradicted by the actions we take. This may be because words are easy to spew out, but you can only perform so many actions in a day. Actions must be more thought out and are a more accurate measure of what you really intend to do ","Ralph Waldo Emerson",
	"“Tough times never last, but tough people do.”<br><br>It’s true that even the toughest of times don’t last forever, and as long as you remain strong you’ll make it through and be able to weather whatever storms come your way. The human spirit has shown that it’s capable of making it through tough times, and getting to the end of the tunnel. The best part of dealing with adversity is that it toughens you up for the next trial in your life. ","Dr. Robert Schuller",
	"“Keep your face to the sunshine and you can never see the shadow.”<br><br>As long as you’re looking on the bright side of things you’ll be ignoring the not-so-good things in your life. What you give attention to grows, so if you’re focusing on what’s wrong in your life you’ll just get more of it to focus on. But if you focus on what’s right in your life, what makes you happy, what you’re grateful for, and why things are so fantastic for you, you’ll only get more of the same to be happy and grateful for. ","Helen Keller",
	"“There is only one success: to be able to spend your life in your own way.”<br><br>It’s your life, your one and only life, and it would be a shame to spend it in a way that doesn’t suit you. But many of us wish that things were different. Either we’re unsatisfied with our jobs, or our relationships, or just the way things are going. It’s vital to your overall success to make changes as you see fit so that you can have your life be the way you really want it to be. ","Christopher Morley",
	"“The best way out is always through.”<br><br>If you’re in a tough spot it’s tempting to think of a clever way around it, but this serves as a reminder to just take the most direct route: through. You’ll find that a funny thing happens when you make up your mind to barrel through whatever dilemma you’re facing. Everything starts shifting when you stop hemming and hawing and finally decide to take actions to make your way through. ","Robert Frost",
	"“The power of imagination makes us infinite.”<br><br>You use your imagination each day, even if you think you don’t. No matter how big or small your accomplishments today, it all began in your imagination. You can use it as much or as little as you want, but it’s the starting point for everything that happens in your life, from what you eat, to what you wear, to what you do. It all begins as pictures in your mind. Be sure to harness the full power of your imagination to dream up bigger and better things for yourself. ","John Muir",
	"“Make each day your masterpiece.”<br><br>It’s easy to lose sight of the importance of each day, because we seem to have so many of them. But it’s been said that a single day serves as a microcosm of your life, so be sure to spend your days in a way that embodies the way you want to live your life. At the end of it all your life will boil down to the accumulation of all of your days, and will serve as your masterpiece, so be sure to spend time each day chiseling the great sculpture that is your life. ","John Wooden",
	"“The best dreams happen when you’re awake.”< br><br>Living a life that feels like a dream is the ultimate goal, isn’t it? You don’t want to save your best experiences for dreams experienced while you’re sleeping, because as tantalizing as they are they aren’t real. Having real moment in life that feel surreal and dreamlike is a wonderful thing to have, and the good news is that you can create this with focus and determination by making it your goal.","Cherie Gilderbloom",
	"“Once you choose hope, anything’s possible.”<BR><BR>The opposite of this quote is also true, once you give up hope or choose hopelessness, nothing’s possible. Hope is the feeling that things will somehow get better, that they will somehow work out. You don’t even have to know how it will happen, but it’s the believe or even the wish that it will. That’s why it’s never a good idea to give up hope because you just don’t know how things will pan out. ","Christopher Reeve",
	"Every moment is a fresh beginning.”<BR><BR>It’s interesting to think that you can start anew with each passing moment. You can let go of the past, let go of whatever is holding you back, and start again, doing whatever it is you want to do. It’s refreshing to know that the present is not entirely enmeshed in the past, and your future is being created moment by moment.  ","T.S. Eliot ",
	"“Believe and act as if it were impossible to fail.”<BR><BR>What a great way to greet the world! Acting might come before believing on this one, as it’s not an easy task to believe that it’s impossible to fail. It might be a case of faking it until you make it, taking bold actions as if you really believe that you can’t fail, and then building up your confidence and your belief that you really can’t. ","Charles Kettering",
	"We dont get a chance to do that many things, and every one should be really excellent.Because this is our life. Life is brief, and then you die, you know? And we have all chosen todo this with our lives. So it better be damn good. It better be worth it.","Steve Jobs",

"All my life I had been looking for something, and everywhere I turned someone tried to tell me what it was. I accepted their answers too, though they were often in contradiction and even self-contradictory. I was naïve. I was looking for myself and asking everyone except myself questions which I, and only I, could answer. It took me a long time and much painful boomeranging of my expectations to achieve a realization everyone else appears to have been born with: that I am nobody but myself. ","Ralph Ellison",

"Imagine there is a bank account that credits your account each morning with $86,400. It carries over no balance from day to day.Every evening the bank deletes whatever part of the balance you failed to use during the day. What would you do? Draw out every cent, of course?Each of us has such a bank. It's name is TIME.Every morning, it credits you with 86,400 seconds.Every night it writes off as lost, whatever of this you have failed to invest to a good purpose.It carries over no balance. It allows no over draft. Each day it opens a new account for you. Each night it burns the remains of the day.If you fail to use the day's deposits, the loss is yours. There is no drawing against tomorrow.You must live in the present on today's deposits. Invest it so as to get from it the utmost in health, happiness and success! The clock is running!!
